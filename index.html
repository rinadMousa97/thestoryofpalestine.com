		Palestine was a common name used until 1948 to describe the geographic region between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. In its history, the Assyrian, Babylonian, Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman empires have controlled Palestine at one time or another.

After World War I, Palestine was administered by the United Kingdom under a Mandate received in 1922 from the League of Nations. The modern history of Palestine begins with the termination of the British Mandate, the Partition of Palestine and the creation of Israel, and the ensuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Partition of Palestine
In 1947, the United Nations (U.N.) proposed a Partition Plan for Palestine titled “United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 (II) Future Government of Palestine.” The resolution noted Britain’s planned termination of the British Mandate for Palestine and recommended the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, with the Jerusalem-Bethlehem area protected and administered by the United Nations.

The resolution included a highly detailed description of the recommended boundaries for each proposed state. The resolution also contained plans for an economic union between the proposed states and for the protection of religious and minority rights. The resolution called for the withdrawal of British forces and termination of the Mandate by August 1948 and establishment of the new independent states by October 1948.

    	The current map of Palestine is often described as resembling “Swiss cheese”. Over the past century it has been carved up, walled-in and filled with hundreds of illegal Israeli settlements and military checkpoints.

Now, in the latest round of Israel’s ongoing occupation and policy of land-grabs this map could become even more disjointed. On July 1, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to announce Israel’s annexation of the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea.

    	Culture of Paletine:
    	
    </div>

    <p class="text_para">

    	Palestinian heritage will always remain the most important spring. It is the inexhaustible well for the various Palestinian literature and arts, for its significance affirming the Palestinian identity and embedding the Palestinians’ unity with all its religious and ethnic sects. Belonging to such heritage, supporting and reviving it, one generation after the other, is a holy cultural mission, around which all arts and literature are gathered, surpassing its spatial boundaries to the wider global spheres.

In this manner, the Palestinian heritage is one of the major indestructible resilience for the Palestinians in their journey of struggle that spanned for more than seven decades until today, towards retrieving their historical rights that was deprived of them by the Israeli occupation.

Since the middle of the 20th century or even before that, the culture of Palestinian lands was exposed to tireless attempts to obliterate its identity that is as eternal as its holy lands, as persistent as its ancient alleys. Nevertheless, the innovations of Palestinians – even those deceased – remain as resilient as a frim wall against these attempts. Wherein the writings of Ghassan Kanafi are still inspiring a lot of intellectuals across the Arab world, let alone Palestine’s intellectuals. Poems of Mahmoud Darwish and Samih al-Qasim are also still echoing in official and public cultural gatherings. And the caricature character “Hanzala” of the famous cartoonist Naji al-Ali is still adorning the necks of young people of different ages. Those and others have contributed to affirming the Palestinian heritage and reviving its aesthetics, in the context of forming the collective cultural awareness unifying the Palestinians.

Also, the bagpipe played with the Palestinian Dabke (a traditional group dance), alongside Oud and Qanun, are still some of the preserving means of the Palestinian culture, by clinging to its first melodies, which are plunged deep into Palestinian history.

In the fashion world, the distinctive hand-embroidered Palestinian dress sparkles with great craftsmanship, which can be found in every Palestinian house, In addition to men’s keffiyehs and Agal that are considered means of preserving the Palestinian culture alongside all forms of artistic and literary creativity.

The Israeli government has attempted to consolidate its control over Jerusalem by systematically pursuing a number of policies including establishing settlements: Israel has attempted to integrate occupied East Jerusalem into Israel through constructing illegal settlements with and along the unilaterally expanded borders. These settlements now form a ring around the Palestinian population at the heart of the city, sealing it off from the rest of the West Bank .Today more than 277,501 of the approximately 560,546 settlers in the occupied Palestinians territories live in occupied East Jerusalem ,almost 49% of the total settler population.
